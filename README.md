# My_Web_Portfolio

## Create Web Application to Showcase my and Market my Portfolio

- I needed to create a site containing information about me professionally which containins links to projects I have worked and collaborated on.
- The site contains a photo of me, some background information, images containing links to my deployed projects, and my contact information.
- The nav bar links jump to the sections as labeled.
- The various elements on the page are built using flexbox styling in css to accomodate adaptation to various size viewports.

## Installation & Usage

Installation & usage is simply through loading the public url into your browswer search bar and using the links to navigate.
